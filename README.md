# Pokemon APP sprint

This project was made as a practice for <br/>
TypeScript, SASS and redux/toolkit in the form <br/>
of a limited time challenge. <br/>

I took a day for studying and seven days for <br/>
programming, which ended in this visually <br/>
appealing altough incomplete project.

The features that I could implement in time are:

+ Pokedex:
  + Search by name and id number.
  + Clickable evolution chain.
  + All important info displayed.
  + Visuals.
    
+ Flippo's:
  + Flipping effect on hover.
  + Image editing to get the backgrounds.
  + Strong against section at the back.         
  + Visuals.
    
+ Creation:
  + Slider input using pure-react.
  + React controlled select.
  + Visuals
